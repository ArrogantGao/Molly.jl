# Molly documentation

Molly takes a modular approach to molecular simulation.
To run a simulation you create a [`Simulation`](@ref) object and call [`simulate!`](@ref) on it.
The different components of the simulation can be used as defined by the package, or you can define your own versions.
An important principle of the package is that your custom components, particularly force functions, should be easy to define and just as performant as the in-built versions.

For more information on specific types or functions, see the [Molly API](@ref) section or call `?function_name` in Julia.

## Simulating a gas

Let's look at the simulation of a gas acting under the [Lennard-Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential) potential to start with.
First, we'll need some atoms with the relevant parameters defined.
```julia
using Molly

n_atoms = 100
mass = 10.0
atoms = [Atom(mass=mass, σ=0.3, ϵ=0.2) for i in 1:n_atoms]
```
Next, we'll need some starting coordinates and velocities.
```julia
box_size = 2.0 # nm
coords = [box_size .* rand(SVector{3}) for i in 1:n_atoms]

temperature = 100 # K
velocities = [velocity(mass, temperature) for i in 1:n_atoms]
```
We store the coordinates and velocities as [static arrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl) for performance.
They can be of any number of dimensions and of any number type, e.g. `Float64` or `Float32`.
Now we can define our dictionary of general interactions, i.e. those between most or all atoms.
Because we have defined the relevant parameters for the atoms, we can use the built-in Lennard Jones type.
```julia
general_inters = Dict("LJ" => LennardJones())
```
Finally, we can define and run the simulation.
We use an Andersen thermostat to keep a constant temperature, and we log the temperature and coordinates every 10 steps.
```julia
s = Simulation(
    simulator=VelocityVerlet(), # Use velocity Verlet integration
    atoms=atoms,
    general_inters=general_inters,
    coords=coords,
    velocities=velocities,
    temperature=temperature,
    box_size=box_size,
    thermostat=AndersenThermostat(1.0), # Coupling constant of 1.0
    loggers=Dict("temp" => TemperatureLogger(10),
                    "coords" => CoordinateLogger(10)),
    timestep=0.002, # ps
    n_steps=1_000
)

simulate!(s)
```
By default the simulation is run in parallel on the [number of threads](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/parallel-computing/#man-multithreading-1) available to Julia, but this can be turned off by giving the keyword argument `parallel=false` to [`simulate!`](@ref).
An animation of the stored coordinates using can be saved using [`visualize`](@ref), which is available when [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) is imported.
```julia
using Makie
visualize(s.loggers["coords"], box_size, "sim_lj.gif")
```

## Simulating diatomic molecules

If we want to define specific interactions between atoms, for example bonds, we can do.
Using the same atom definitions as before, let's set up the coordinates so that paired atoms are 1 Å apart.
```julia
coords = [box_size .* rand(SVector{3}) for i in 1:(n_atoms / 2)]
for i in 1:length(coords)
    push!(coords, coords[i] .+ [0.1, 0.0, 0.0])
end

velocities = [velocity(mass, temperature) for i in 1:n_atoms]
```
Now we can use the built-in bond type to place a harmonic constraint between paired atoms.
The arguments are the indices of the two atoms in the bond, the equilibrium distance and the force constant.
```julia
bonds = [Bond(i, Int(i + n_atoms / 2), 0.1, 300_000.0) for i in 1:Int(n_atoms / 2)]

specific_inter_lists = Dict("Bonds" => bonds)
```
This time, we are also going to use a neighbour list to speed up the Lennard Jones calculation.
We can use the built-in distance neighbour finder.
The arguments are a 2D array of eligible interactions, the number of steps between each update and the cutoff in nm to be classed as a neighbour.
```julia
neighbour_finder = DistanceNeighbourFinder(trues(n_atoms, n_atoms), 10, 1.2)
```
Now we can simulate as before.
```julia
s = Simulation(
    simulator=VelocityVerlet(),
    atoms=atoms,
    specific_inter_lists=specific_inter_lists,
    general_inters=Dict("LJ" => LennardJones(true)), # true means we are using the neighbour list for this interaction
    coords=coords,
    velocities=velocities,
    temperature=temperature,
    box_size=box_size,
    neighbour_finder=neighbour_finder,
    thermostat=AndersenThermostat(1.0),
    loggers=Dict("temp" => TemperatureLogger(10),
                    "coords" => CoordinateLogger(10)),
    timestep=0.002,
    n_steps=1_000
)

simulate!(s)
```
This time when we view the trajectory we can add lines to show the bonds.
```julia
visualize(s.loggers["coords"], box_size, "sim_diatomic.gif",
            connections=[(i, Int(i + n_atoms / 2)) for i in 1:Int(n_atoms / 2)],
            markersize=0.05, linewidth=5.0)
```

## Simulating a protein in the OPLS-AA forcefield

Molly has a rudimentary parser of Gromacs topology and coordinate files.
Data for a protein can be read into the same data structures as above, and simulated in the same way.
```julia
atoms, specific_inter_lists, general_inters, nb_matrix, coords, box_size = readinputs(
            joinpath(dirname(pathof(Molly)), "..", "data", "5XER", "gmx_top_ff.top"),
            joinpath(dirname(pathof(Molly)), "..", "data", "5XER", "gmx_coords.gro"))

temperature = 298

s = Simulation(
    simulator=VelocityVerlet(),
    atoms=atoms,
    specific_inter_lists=specific_inter_lists,
    general_inters=general_inters,
    coords=coords,
    velocities=[velocity(a.mass, temperature) for a in atoms],
    temperature=temperature,
    box_size=box_size,
    neighbour_finder=DistanceNeighbourFinder(nb_matrix, 10),
    thermostat=AndersenThermostat(1.0),
    loggers=Dict("temp" => TemperatureLogger(10),
                    "writer" => StructureWriter(10, "traj_5XER_1ps.pdb")),
    timestep=0.0002,
    n_steps=5_000
)

simulate!(s)
```
The [`StructureWriter`](@ref) records a PDB file of the trajectory.
