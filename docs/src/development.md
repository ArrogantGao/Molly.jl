## Running tests

The tests will automatically include multithreading and/or GPU tests if multiple threads and/or a CUDA-enabled GPU are available.
`test/runtests.jl` does not include all the tests due to CI time limits, see the test directory for more, though these extra tests do not need to be run for every change.
Various environmental variables can be set to modify the tests:
- `VISTESTS` determines whether to run the GLMakie.jl plotting tests which will error on remote systems where a display is not available, default `VISTESTS=1`.
- `GPUTESTS` determines whether to run the GPU tests, default `GPUTESTS=1`.
- `DEVICE` determines which GPU to run on, default `DEVICE=0`.
- `GROUP` can be used to run a subset of the tests, options `All`/`Protein`/`Zygote`, default `GROUP=All`.
