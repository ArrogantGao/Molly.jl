# Molly API

The API reference can be found here.

Molly also re-exports [StaticArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl), making the likes of `SVector` available when you call `using Molly`.

The [`visualize`](@ref) function is only available once you have called `using Makie`.
[Requires.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Requires.jl) is used to lazily load this code when [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) is available, which reduces the dependencies of the package.
