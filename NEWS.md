# Molly.jl release notes

## v0.2.2 - Feb 2021

- The `TreeNeighbourFinder` is added for faster distance neighbour finding using NearestNeighbors.jl.

## v0.2.1 - Dec 2020

- Documentation is added for cutoffs.
- Compatibility bounds are updated for various packages, including requiring CUDA.jl version 2.
- Support for Julia versions before 1.5 is dropped.

## v0.2.0 - Sep 2020

- Shifted potential and shifted force cutoff approaches for non-bonded interactions are introduced.
- An `EnergyLogger` is added and the potential energy for existing interactions defined.
- Simulations can now be run with the `CuArray` type from CUDA.jl, allowing GPU acceleration.
- The in-place `force!` functions are changed to out-of-place `force` functions with different arguments.
- The i-i self-interaction is no longer computed for `force` functions.
- The Mie potential is added.
- The list of neighbours is now stored in the `Simulation` type.
- Documentation is added for experimental differentiable molecular simulation.
- Optimisations are implemented throughout the package.
- Support for Julia versions before 1.3 is dropped.

## v0.1.0 - Jun 2020

Initial release of Molly.jl, a Julia package for molecular simulation.

Features:
- Interface to allow definition of new forces, simulators, thermostats, neighbour finders, loggers etc.
- Read in pre-computed Gromacs topology and coordinate files with the OPLS-AA forcefield and run MD on proteins with given parameters. In theory it can do this for any regular protein, but in practice this is untested.
- Non-bonded interactions - Lennard-Jones Van der Waals/repulsion force, electrostatic Coulomb potential, gravitational potential, soft sphere potential.
- Bonded interactions - covalent bonds, bond angles, torsion angles.
- Andersen thermostat.
- Velocity Verlet and velocity-free Verlet integration.
- Explicit solvent.
- Periodic boundary conditions in a cubic box.
- Neighbour list to speed up calculation of non-bonded forces.
- Automatic multithreading.
- Some analysis functions, e.g. RDF.
- Run with Float64 or Float32.
- Physical agent-based modelling.
- Visualise simulations as animations.
